Dear Employer, 
    I have worked commercially with all the languages in your advertisement. At this time I work mainly with C#.net MVC on a daily basis. I have a broad knowledge of different frameworks and technologies to which I feel I would be an asset when migrating legacy applications to new technologies. I have had clearance in the past working with HP->HPE->DXC. I am a friendly happy person and feel I would easily slip into your team and be a productive member very quickly. I'm not afraid of a challenge and quickly adapt to change.
